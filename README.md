# Basic stuff that you might wanna know when making a loader

This is an example in how you should make tokens for each session in your loader and how you should treat the session once it is started.

Make sure that you allow a token per user and check for a session validation in each login.

This is a super basic example in how to manage your loader for your project :D

Have fun.
